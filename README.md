This repository contains solutions for a set of basic and advanced Python assignments. Each assignment covers fundamental and intermediate concepts of Python, including:

Data Types and Variables: Working with different data types (integers, strings, lists, etc.) and variable assignments.
Control Flow: Using if statements, loops (for and while), and conditional expressions.
Advanced Python Concepts: Topics like string manipulation, exception handling, and context managers.
Libraries: Hands-on experience with popular Python libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, Pandas for data manipulation, and SciPy for scientific and technical computing.
These assignments aim to provide a well-rounded understanding of both basic and advanced Python programming.
